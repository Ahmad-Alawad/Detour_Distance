This program was a programming challenge is an optional part of the job application to be a Software Engineer at Lyft.
This is copy pasted from the job posting:

Calculate the detour distance between two different rides.
Given four latitude / longitude pairs, where driver one is traveling from point A to point B and driver two is traveling from point C to point D, write a function (in your language of choice) to calculate the shorter of the detour distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and drop-off the other driver.
